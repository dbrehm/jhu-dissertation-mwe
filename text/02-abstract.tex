A search is presented for pair production of the standard model Higgs boson using data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC in 2016--2018, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137\fbinv. 
The final state consists of two $\cPqb$ quark-antiquark pairs. 
The search is conducted in the region of phase space where at least one pair is highly Lorentz-boosted and is reconstructed as a single large-area jet. 
Depending on the resonance mass, the other Higgs boson may be sufficiently boosted to be also reconstructed as another large-area jet or using two $\cPqb$-tagged jets. 
The results are obtained by statistically combining the analysis channels. Limits on the product of the cross sections and branching fractions are set for narrow and wide bulk gravitons and radions in warped extra-dimensional models having a mass in the range 1000--3000 $GeV$.
Extensions of this search to include Vector Boson Fusion and substituting a Higgs boson for a light scalar Y in the final state of two $\cPqb$ quark-antiquark pairs are also discussed.
New limits are set on the quartic HHVV coupling constant. Expected limits on the mass of the light scalar and heavy resonance interpreted in the context of scalar resonances are presented.
Upper limits are placed on the production cross section of the process as a function of the masses of X and Y.
